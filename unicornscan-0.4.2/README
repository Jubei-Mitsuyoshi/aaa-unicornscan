THIS IS A PRE-RELEASE CODE BASE

if you read nothing else, read CURRENT_STATUS_OF_THIS_RELEASE

BEFORE YOU TYPE MAKE,
there is no configure script, there will likely be one in the future, for now
1) edit src/config.h
dont worry, its documented, read down to the part where it says you can likely stop
2) edit src/Makefile.inc
same thing, just read the comments, it even has examples for different systems
3) type make
4) type make install

If you see:
+ chcon --help
make: *** [install] Error 127

and you don't have SE Linux, you can safely ignore that message.

have fun, be good, and please talk to us.
